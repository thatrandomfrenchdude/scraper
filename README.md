# Software Specification: Python Web Scraping Tool

## 1. Introduction

The Python Web Scraping Tool is a generic scraper designed to extract all text content from a given web page. The tool converts the extracted text into a JSON representation of the page, preserving the hierarchy and structure of the content. The resulting JSON file is then saved to the "outputs" directory with the filename corresponding to the website's name.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1. Input Requirements

The scraper tool should take the following inputs:

- **Target URL:** The URL of the web page to be scraped. The tool should validate the URL format and accessibility.
- **Output Directory:** The directory where the JSON output file will be saved. If the "outputs" directory doesn't exist, the tool should create it.

### 2.2. Output Requirements

The scraper tool should produce the following outputs:

- **JSON Output File:** The extracted text from the web page should be converted into a JSON representation of the page's content, preserving the hierarchy and structure of the text. Each level of nesting should be maintained in the JSON output.
- **File Naming Convention:** The output file should be named after the website's name without any file extension (e.g., example_com.json, openai_org.json).

### 2.3. Scraping Functionality

The scraping tool should perform the following actions:

- **Connect to the Target URL:** Establish a connection to the provided URL and validate its accessibility. If the URL is invalid or the connection fails, an appropriate error message should be displayed.
- **Retrieve Web Page Content:** Fetch the HTML content of the web page. If the HTML retrieval fails, an appropriate error message should be displayed.
- **Extract Text Content:** Parse the HTML content and extract all visible text elements. Ignore non-visible content such as scripts, stylesheets, and comments.
- **Convert to JSON:** Convert the extracted text content into a JSON representation while preserving the structure and hierarchy of the text. Each HTML element should be represented as a JSON object with the following properties:
    - **tag:** The HTML tag of the element.
    - **text:** The text content of the element.
    - **children:** An array of child elements (nested JSON objects).

### 2.4. JSON Output File Generation

The scraper tool should save the JSON output file as follows:

- **Directory:** Save the output file in the "outputs" directory relative to the location of the Python script. If the "outputs" directory doesn't exist, create it.
- **Filename:** Use the website name as the filename for the JSON output file. Remove any special characters and spaces from the website name.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

The scraper tool should adhere to the following non-functional requirements:

- **Python Version:** The tool should be implemented in Python 3.x.
- **Robustness:** Handle various error scenarios gracefully, providing clear and informative error messages to assist with troubleshooting.
- **Performance:** The tool should be efficient in processing web pages, minimizing resource usage and response times.
- **User Interface:** The tool can be executed via the command line or through a graphical user interface (GUI). If a GUI is provided, it should have intuitive controls for specifying the URL and output directory.
- **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive documentation and usage instructions to guide users in setting up and running the scraper tool.

## 4. Constraints

The scraper tool should operate within the following constraints:

- **Legal and Ethical Use:** The tool should be used in compliance with the legal and ethical guidelines of web scraping. Respect the website's terms of service and avoid scraping private or sensitive information without proper authorization.
- **Text Content Only:** The tool should focus on extracting text content from web pages. Extraction of media files, binary data, or non-textual content is out of scope.
- **Single Web Page:** The tool should be designed to scrape a single web page at a time. Scraping multiple pages or entire websites is beyond the scope of this tool.

This software specification provides a high-level overview of the requirements for the Python Web Scraping Tool. Further design and implementation details should be considered during the development process to ensure the successful creation of the tool.
